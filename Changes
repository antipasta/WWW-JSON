    - Added response->error 
    - Experimental ability for a response to retry itself via resp->retry(), still thinking this through so it's not in the perldoc yet
    - Create HTTP::Response objects instead of using lwp->get, ->post etc
    - Refactored how auth roles work, no more using lwp->default_header('Authorization') nonsense
    - Added a simple example using the metacpan api
    - Can pass arbitrary options to useragent via ua_options
